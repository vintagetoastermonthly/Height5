# Data Augmentation

## Overview

Two augmentation strategies have been implemented for the Height5 model:

1. **Rotation Augmentation**: Random 90° rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270° clockwise) to increase data diversity and rotation invariance
2. **Image Dropout**: Random dropout of individual input images to improve robustness to missing or corrupted data

Both augmentations are applied only to training data and maintain spatial consistency across all views.

## How It Works

### 1. Rotation Application

All images are rotated by the same randomly chosen angle (k × 90° where k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}):
- **Ortho image**: Rotated by k × 90°
- **All 4 oblique images**: Each rotated by k × 90°
- **Target DSM**: Rotated by k × 90°

### 2. Oblique Remapping

After rotation, the oblique dictionary keys are remapped to maintain directional consistency. When the scene rotates clockwise, the viewing directions shift:

**90° Clockwise (k=1):**
```
north → east    (what was north is now viewed from east)
east → south
south → west
west → north
```

**180° Rotation (k=2):**
```
north → south
east → west
south → north
west → east
```

**270° Clockwise (k=3):**
```
north → west
east → north
south → east
west → south
```

### 3. Why Remapping Is Necessary

The oblique images are named by the direction they view **FROM**. When we rotate the entire scene:
- The physical content rotates
- The viewing angles remain fixed to the images
- Therefore, we must remap which image represents which cardinal direction

**Example:** After rotating 90° clockwise, what was the "north oblique" (viewing from north toward south) is now viewing from what we call "east" in the rotated coordinate frame.

## Image Dropout Augmentation

### How It Works

Each of the 5 input images (ortho + 4 obliques) has an independent probability of being dropped (replaced with zeros) during training. This makes the model robust to:
- Missing images in real-world deployments
- Corrupted or low-quality images
- Partial sensor failures

**Key features:**
- Each image dropped independently (not all at once)
- Configurable drop probability (default: 0%, recommended: 10%)
- Only applied to training data
- Applied AFTER rotation augmentation (so rotated images can be dropped)
- Target DSM is never dropped

### Drop Probability Statistics

With `--drop_prob 0.1`, across 1000 samples:
- Expected: ~100 drops per view (10%)
- Observed: 96-109 drops per view (9.6-10.9%)
- Overall: ~10.4% dropout rate ✓

## Usage

### Training with Augmentations

**Rotation only:**
```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data --batch_size 8 --augment
```

**Dropout only:**
```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data --batch_size 8 --drop_prob 0.1
```

**Both (recommended):**
```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data --batch_size 8 --augment --drop_prob 0.1
```

### Implementation Details

**In dataset.py:**
- `HeightEstimationDataset.__init__(augment=bool, drop_prob=float)`: Enable/disable augmentations
- `_apply_rotation_augmentation()`: Apply random rotation to all images
- `_remap_obliques_for_rotation()`: Remap oblique keys after rotation
- `_apply_image_dropout()`: Randomly zero out input images

**In train.py:**
- `--augment` flag: Enable rotation augmentation
- `--drop_prob` parameter: Set dropout probability (0.0-1.0)
- Both passed to `create_dataloaders()` function

**Application Order in `__getitem__`:**
1. Load all images from disk
2. Apply rotation augmentation (if enabled)
3. Apply image dropout (if enabled)
4. Return augmented sample

**Key Points:**
- Augmentations only apply to **training data** (not validation)
- Rotation is applied **before** dropout (so rotated images can be dropped)
- All rotation angles applied to all 6 images (5 views + target)
- Dropout only applied to 5 input views (target never dropped)
- Validation data is never augmented to ensure consistent evaluation

## Testing

Run the augmentation test suites:

**Rotation augmentation:**
```bash
python test_augmentation.py
```

The test verifies:
1. Basic augmentation functionality
2. Correct oblique remapping for all rotation angles
3. Spatial consistency across multiple samples

**Image dropout:**
```bash
python test_dropout.py
```

The test verifies:
1. Basic dropout functionality
2. Correct dropout probability (~10% across 1000 samples)
3. Combined rotation + dropout augmentation
4. No dropout in validation data

## Benefits

**Rotation Augmentation:**
1. **4× Effective Dataset Size**: Each sample can appear in 4 orientations
2. **Rotation Invariance**: Model learns that height estimation shouldn't depend on cardinal direction
3. **Better Generalization**: Reduces overfitting on smaller datasets

**Image Dropout:**
1. **Robustness to Missing Data**: Model learns to estimate heights even with incomplete views
2. **Prevents Over-reliance**: Forces model to utilize information from all views effectively
3. **Real-World Applicability**: Handles scenarios where some images are corrupted or unavailable
4. **Implicit Regularization**: Acts as a regularization technique to reduce overfitting

**Combined:**
- Complementary benefits: rotation for invariance, dropout for robustness
- Effective dataset size: 4× from rotation, with robust multi-view learning from dropout
- Model can handle real-world deployment scenarios with partial or rotated data

## Performance Impact

**Rotation:**
- Negligible computational overhead (efficient `torch.rot90()`)
- No additional memory
- Slightly longer epoch time: ~5-10% increase

**Dropout:**
- Negligible computational overhead (simple zero masking)
- No additional memory
- Minimal impact on epoch time: <2% increase

**Combined:**
- Total overhead: ~10-12% longer epoch time
- Faster convergence typically compensates for longer epochs
- Better final performance justifies the small overhead

## Example Output

  Image dropout: Enabled (10% per image)
VAL set: 1000 clips
```

## Technical Notes

**Rotation:**
- Uses `torch.rot90()` with `k=-k` for clockwise rotation (since torch.rot90 is counter-clockwise by default)
- Rotation dims are `[1, 2]` for (H, W) spatial dimensions of (C, H, W) tensors
- Oblique remapping uses dictionary inversion to maintain correct key-value mapping
- Random seed per sample ensures different rotations across epochs

**Dropout:**
- Uses `torch.zeros_like()` to create zero-filled replacement tensors
- Each image has independent random draw from `torch.rand(1)`
- Applied at tensor level (after preprocessing to normalized [0,1] values)
- Zero padding is distinguishable from actual black images (which have RGB patterns)
- Model must learn to handle missing information through cross-attention fusion
